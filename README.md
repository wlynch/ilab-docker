# ilab-docker

This project is part getting to know docker, and part building something
useful for Rutgers students.

The ultimate goal is to generate a docker image that will simulate the iLab
machines so that students can develop locally, and run their code in a docker
container.

## Installation

See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
